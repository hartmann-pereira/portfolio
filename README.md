# [Project 1: Data driven loan payment prediction](https://github.com/hartmann-pereira/D/blob/main/Data_Drive_Loan_Payment_Prediction.ipynb)
* Simple project exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com from 2007 to 2010 as a csv file.
* This project starts with data visualization to better understand the imported data.
* Data is cleaned to be prepared to be applied some simple scikit learn models.
* I am looking to understand what has more impact in wether someone will pay back the loan.
* Created two models using decision trees and random forest to help predict.
* Presented the classification report and confusion matrix.

# [Project 2: Customer Analysis Dashboard using Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/CustomerAnalysisusingsalesdata/Painel1?:language=pt-BR&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
* This dashboard was created using sales dataset for 2021 and 2022
* The main questions I was looking for to answer with this dashboard build were: 
* Revenue per state | Revenue based on month of the year | Revenue based on customer age | Revenue per category per gender and finaly Revenue per payment method.
* I decided to apply filters to choose between multiple cathegories for easy comparison and also display the total revenue value
