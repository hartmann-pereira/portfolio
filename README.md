# Project 1: Data driven loan payment prediction 
* Simple project exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com from 2007 to 2010 as a csv file.
* This project starts with data visualization to better understand the imported data.
* Data is cleaned to be prepared to be applied some simple scikit learn models.
* I am looking to understand what has more impact in wether someone will pay back the loan.
* Created two models using decision trees and random forest to help predict.
* Presented the classification report and confusion matrix.
